### Code of Conduct
Be respectful, inclusive, and supportive. Treat all contributors with kindness. If you need help or encounter issues, reach out via [issues] or our community channels.

### How to Contribute
- Fork the repo  
- Clone and branch off `main`  
- Make your changes, document them, and test thoroughly  

### Development Setup
Please refer to [architecture.md] for project structure. Begin in any of these sandboxes:
- `core/` — foundational logic  
- `panels/` — frontend UI logic  
- `cache/`, `network/`, `roger/`, etc.

### Standards
- **Follow our code style** (match existing patterns)  
- **Use commit messages** that are clear, descriptive, and present-tense  
- **Add tests** for new behavior or bug fixes  

### Submitting Changes
1. Open an issue with your idea before coding  
2. Submit a PR with “fixes #…” or “resolves #…” in the description  
3. Maintain an up-to-date changelog  

### Review Process
- PRs are reviewed collaboratively—expect feedback  
- We may request clarifications or smaller, focused changes  
- Approvals indicate readiness for merge; maintainers handle merging

### Where to Begin
Check labels like `good first issue` or `help wanted`. Read [architecture.md] for orientation. Reach out if you’re unsure where to start!

Happy building!
